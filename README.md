Welcome to text based Chess! This is a two player only version of Chess in which you control your pieces using algebraic notation.
Each square on the chess board is designated a set of coordinates. These coordinates are shown on the board.
Control your pieces by first listing the piece you want to move, then the coordinate you want it to move to.
The names of each piece are shown on the board. An example of a valid move would be: Pc6, which moves one of your pawns up one space.
If two pieces can move to the same space, list the piece name, then its current coordinates, then the destination coordinates.
The game will create a history of your moves as you play the game. When you're done playing, you can look at the log
and try to improve on your gameplay! Enjoy!
